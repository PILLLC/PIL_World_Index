An open, versioned, citation-forward country reference maintained with open data,
transparent editorial rules, and automated generation tooling.

This project is intended as a public, open alternative to legacy government
factbook-style references, built using open-source data, AsciiDoc, GitHub
versioning, and AI-assisted generation with human review.

== Goals
* Provide country and territory profiles in a consistent, readable format
* Ensure every key claim is attributable to a public source
* Support versioned releases for reproducibility and citation
* Enable automated regeneration while preserving editorial control

== Repository Structure
* `profiles/by-iso/<ISO3>/` — country profiles in `.adoc`
* `sources/registry.yml` — canonical source registry (provenance + licensing)
* `docs/` — style guide, editorial policy, schema, and release process
* `templates/` — reusable AsciiDoc templates
* `.github/workflows/` — validation and CI rules

== Core Principles
* Descriptive, not prescriptive
* Neutral tone
* Explicit sourcing
* Clear timestamps and release metadata
* Transparent handling of disputed or contested information

== Status
This project is in early scaffold stage. Initial work focuses on:
* Establishing structure and editorial rules
* Defining a minimal, high-quality indicator set
* Building a reproducible AsciiDoc-based publishing workflow
