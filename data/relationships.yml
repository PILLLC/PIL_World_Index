# PIL World Index — Cross-Entity Relationships Registry
# Purpose: a single, auditable place to record links between entities
# Entities should be referenced by their slugs and type:
# - country:<slug>  (e.g., country:ukraine)
# - org:<slug>      (e.g., org:nato)
#
# Every relationship must have at least one source.
# Keep language descriptive; avoid predictions.
