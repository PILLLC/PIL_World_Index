This document defines the minimum content schema for country and territory
profiles in the PIL World Index.

The schema is intentionally simple and extensible to support both human-
authored and AI-assisted generation.

== Country Profile Schema

Each country profile is represented by a directory:

`profiles/by-iso/<ISO3>/`

At minimum, the directory must contain:

* `index.adoc` — the canonical country profile

== Required Metadata
Each `index.adoc` must include the following attributes at the top of the file:

[source,adoc]
----
:iso3: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code
:iso2: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code
:wdid: Wikidata Q identifier
:last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD
:release: YYYY.MM

== Recommended Sections

== Key Indicators Table
