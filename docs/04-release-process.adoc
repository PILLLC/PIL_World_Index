= Release Process

The PIL World Index is published through a lightweight, transparent release process.
Releases are designed to make changes traceable, reviewable, and reproducible over time.

This process applies to all country profiles, organization profiles, relationships, and supporting data.

== Release Philosophy

Releases prioritize:

* Transparency over speed
* Traceability over completeness
* Incremental improvement over one-time publication

A release does not imply finality. It represents a stable snapshot of the index at a given point in time.

== Release Types

The following release types are used:

=== Patch Releases

Patch releases include:

* Source URL corrections
* Typographical fixes
* Formatting or structural alignment
* Non-substantive clarifications

Patch releases do not introduce new indicators or materially alter interpretations.

Example:
----
v0.1.1
----

=== Minor Releases

Minor releases may include:

* New country profiles
* New organization profiles
* New relationship entries
* Expanded context sections using existing sources

Minor releases maintain backward compatibility with the existing schema.

Example:
----
v0.2.0
----

=== Major Releases

Major releases may include:

* Schema changes
* Structural reorganization
* Editorial policy revisions
* Significant expansion of scope or methodology

Major releases may introduce breaking changes and are versioned accordingly.

Example:
----
v1.0.0
----

== Versioning

The PIL World Index follows semantic versioning:

----
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
----

* MAJOR — structural or methodological changes
* MINOR — additive, non-breaking content changes
* PATCH — corrections and refinements

The current release version is recorded in each country and organization profile using the `{release}` attribute.

== Release Workflow

A typical release follows this sequence:

. Changes are developed on a local working copy or feature branch.
. Content is reviewed for structural consistency and sourcing.
. The release version is incremented.
. Changes are committed to the main branch.
. A Git tag corresponding to the release version is created.

Releases are published directly from the main branch.

== Source Freezing

Each release represents a snapshot of source availability at the time of publication.

Sources may update independently after a release.  
Subsequent releases may reflect updated values or interpretations based on newly available data.

== Auditability

All releases remain available through Git history and tagged versions.

This allows:

* Independent review
* Historical comparison
* External reuse and citation

No content is overwritten without trace.

== Future Extensions

Future iterations of the release process may include:

* Automated validation checks
* Change logs generated from commit history
* Scheduled release cadences

These extensions will be introduced incrementally as the index matures.
