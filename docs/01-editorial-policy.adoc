This editorial policy governs all content published in the PIL Factbook.

== Purpose
The PIL Factbook exists to provide a descriptive, reference-style overview of
countries and territories based on verifiable public information.

== Neutrality and Scope
* Content must remain descriptive and non-prescriptive
* Avoid advocacy, political persuasion, or normative judgments
* Present facts and widely accepted interpretations
* Clearly label disputed or contested claims

== Contested Territories and Naming
* Use ISO 3166 conventions for directory naming where applicable
* When names or status are disputed, note alternative names or claims in text
* Prefer UN-style terminology in headings
* Avoid implying recognition or endorsement

== Source Hierarchy
When multiple sources are available, prioritize in this order:

. Primary international statistical agencies (UN, World Bank, IMF, WHO, ITU)
. National statistical offices
. Intergovernmental organizations
. Reputable research institutions
. Wikidata and Wikipedia for identifiers and linkage (not sole authority)

== Sourcing Requirements
* Numeric values must be sourced
* Rankings, superlatives, and time-bound claims must be sourced
* AI-generated content must not introduce new facts without citations

== AI-Assisted Content
AI tools may be used to draft summaries or reorganize sourced material, but:
* All generated content is subject to human review
* All factual content must trace back to registered sources
* Model-generated speculation is prohibited

== Corrections
Errors should be corrected via pull request with a clear explanation and
supporting sources.
