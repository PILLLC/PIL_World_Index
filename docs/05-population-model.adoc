= Population Model
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 2

The PIL World Index is populated through a deliberately constrained, auditable
model designed to prioritize transparency, neutrality, and maintainability.

This document describes *how* content enters the Index over time.
It does not prescribe tooling or automation and does not imply real-time updates.

== Design Goals

The population model is guided by the following goals:

* No unsourced factual claims
* Low long-term maintainer burden
* Clear separation between data, context, and synthesis
* Deterministic, reviewable changes between releases
* Compatibility with human, dataset-driven, and AI-assisted inputs

The Index treats population as an *infrastructure problem*, not a content problem.

== Intake Lanes

Content enters the Index through three conceptual lanes.
All lanes converge into the same repository structure and release process.

=== Lane A: Human Contributions (Pull Requests)

This lane supports direct human-authored contributions.

Typical inputs include:

* New country or organization profiles
* Expanded context sections
* Relationship definitions
* Source registry updates

Requirements:

* Must conform to canonical templates
* Must include verifiable sources
* Must remain descriptive, not prescriptive
* Must pass structural and sourcing review

All changes are submitted via Pull Request and reviewed prior to merge.

=== Lane B: Dataset-Based Updates (Indicators)

This lane supports systematic updates to quantitative indicators.

Conceptually, this includes:

* Population, GDP, and similar indicators
* Values sourced from registered public datasets
* Release-time snapshots rather than continuous sync

Key principles:

* Indicator updates do not alter narrative context
* Every value is traceable to a dataset and access date
* Changes are batched into releases for auditability

This lane enables scale without turning the project into ongoing content operations.

=== Lane C: AI-Assisted Synthesis (Bounded)

AI assistance may be used to draft descriptive summaries or context sections,
subject to strict constraints.

AI assistance:

* May summarize only registered, provided sources
* May not introduce new facts or indicators
* Produces output that is reviewable and replaceable
* Is treated as a synthesis aid, not an authority

All AI-generated content is committed as normal text and governed by the same review standards.

== Release-Centric Population

The Index is populated *by release*, not continuously.

Each release represents:

* A stable snapshot of content
* A fixed set of sources as of publication time
* Explicit versioning across all entities

Population activity may occur between releases, but publication only occurs at release boundaries.

== Quality Gates (Conceptual)

The following quality gates define acceptance criteria.
These may be enforced manually or via automation in the future.

Structural validity:

* Required metadata attributes present
* Correct directory paths and naming
* Tables conform to expected schemas

Sourcing:

* Numeric values are cited
* Time-bound claims include dates and sources
* Relationships include authoritative references

Neutrality:

* No advocacy or opinionated language
* No forecasting or speculative claims
* Descriptive tone only

Release readiness:

* Release identifiers updated
* Last-updated fields populated
* Sources documented

== Scaling Strategy

The Index is expected to grow in phases:

. Gold-standard exemplars define expectations
. Thin coverage expands breadth with minimal depth
. Dataset-driven indicators scale coverage reliably
. Contributors deepen context incrementally
. Optional automation supports validation and reuse

Depth is prioritized over breadth at early stages.

== Stewardship

Public Information Limited maintains:

* Templates and schemas
* Editorial and contribution standards
* Release tagging and publication

Contributors are encouraged to:

* Fork and adapt the Index
* Submit improvements via Pull Request
* Use the structure for independent or downstream work

Population is collaborative, but stewardship remains explicit.

== Summary

The PIL World Index is populated through controlled, source-bound inputs
that favor auditability and reuse over speed or volume.

The population model is intentionally conservative.
Its purpose is to ensure the Index remains trustworthy as it scales.
