This document describes how sources are registered, referenced, and governed
within the PIL Factbook.

The authoritative list of sources lives in:

`/sources/registry.yml`

== Purpose
The sources registry exists to:
* Provide transparency into where data originates
* Clarify licensing and attribution requirements
* Support automated validation and regeneration
* Prevent unsourced or low-quality data from entering the system

== Registry Structure
Each source entry in `registry.yml` includes:

* `id` — short, stable identifier
* `name` — human-readable source name
* `type` — API, CSV, portal, report, etc.
* `url` — canonical homepage or endpoint
* `license` — data license or usage terms
* `refresh` — expected update cadence
* `notes` — attribution rules or caveats

== Using Sources in Content
When referencing a source in a country profile:
* Use the source name in the footnote
* Include dataset names, indicator codes, or table identifiers where possible
* Include the year of the data

Example:

`Population (2024): 10,000,000.footnote:[World Bank Open Data, SP.POP.TOTL, 2024.]`

== Adding a New Source
To add a new source:
. Update `sources/registry.yml`
. Include licensing and attribution details
. Reference the source consistently in content
. Submit changes via pull request

== Deprecating Sources
Sources may be deprecated if:
* Licensing changes
* Data quality degrades
* Updates cease

Deprecated sources should remain documented with a clear status note.
