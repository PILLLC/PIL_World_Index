== Overview
Ukraine is a unitary republic in Eastern Europe whose contemporary conditions
are dominated by the effects of Russia’s full-scale invasion that began in 2022.
The country’s near-term trajectory is shaped by defense requirements, population
displacement, infrastructure damage, external financial support, and the
constraints of operating critical systems under persistent security risk.
